# gaitmesh ![CI](https://github.com/ori-drs/gaitmesh/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This package processes a mesh model (or point cloud and mesh) to produce an annotated version of the mesh where each triangle is associated with a choice of gait-controller for a legged robot.
The result can then be used in the package [recast_ros](https://github.com/ori-drs/recast_ros) for multi-controller long-term locomotion planning for a legged robot.

## From a CAD model

As an example, please download the [Barcelona Robotics Lab model](https://www.iri.upc.edu/research/webprojects/pau/datasets/BRL/zip/BRL_obj_wireframe.zip), place it under data/BRL_final.obj, and then run:

```
roslaunch gaitmesh_ros annotate_cloud_gaits.launch input_clouds_not_mesh:=false
```

## From a point cloud

If you have your own point cloud, obtained for example by laser scanning of a site, then follow these steps to produce a triangular mesh:

- Load the cloud in MeshLab
- In MeshLab, run "Surface Reconstruction: Ball Pivoting" with a reasonable radius, e.g. 0.20 meters.
- In MeshLab, run "Close holes" with a reasonable max size, e.g. 40.
- Change "annotate_cloud_gaits.launch" to include the path to your cloud in "cloud1" and the path to the mesh in "cloud_mesh".

Then run:

```
roslaunch gaitmesh_ros annotate_cloud_gaits.launch
```
